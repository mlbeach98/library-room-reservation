# library-room-reservation
VBA macro to automate the task of reserving a study room in a library.

You can enter all the dates you would like to have a room reserved into the spreadsheet, and running this macro once a day it will reserve an available room that meets your criteria (currently just time and length of time) given that something is available. Any filled reservations will be removed from the "Reservations" tab to the "Filled" tab to show the reservation has been requested.

As well, there is a tab created that shows which rooms are currently available or filled. This data could be collected for later analysis on things such as how quick rooms are booked once available, how many rooms are booked at different times of the semester, etc.
